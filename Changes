See ChangeLog for detailed changes.

1.29  2022-11-07
* Removed blib/ directory unintentionally present in 1.28 distribution

1.28  2022-11-07

* Specify GitHub issues as bugtracker
* Incorporate change from Perl/Tk's myConfig:
  exit gracefully if libX11 not found
  (should prevent UNKNOWN reports from CPAN testers)
* Fix build failures caused by an include path (possibly containing Tcl/Tk
  headers) which was specified with higher precedence than Perl/Tk headers

1.26  2020-10-26

* Fix RT #133587: improper handling of line endings differing from `$/`
  in pTk.exc files causes build failure (tries compiling
  known-uncompilable filesâ€”e.g. tkAppInit.c, tkTablePs.c)
* Add GitHub repository to module metadata
* Apply POD fixes (originally by Debian package maintainer Bart Martens)

1.25  2020-10-19

* add dependencies / RT #133557
* improve POD (incl. RT #75690)

1.24  2020-10-17

* pTk/Makefile.PL: fix RT #133547
* improve indentation of myConfig

1.23  2007-01-09

* Changed TableMatrix::Spreadsheet row/col resize behavior to be more
spreadsheet-like.
 
1.22  2006-03-23

* Misc Bugs fixed in Tk::TableMatrix::SpreadsheetHideRows
 
1.21  2006-03-02

* Updated to make the row/size resize operation (that happens when you
  drag the row/col borders) apply to every row or column that is currently
  selected, instead of just the	row/col border that was dragged.
  
1.2  2005-01-26

* Fixed bug which was causing crashes on perl 5.8.4 on win32 when 
  anything was copied into the clipboard (i.e. when control-c pressed).
  
* Fixed row/col insert/deletes to work more reliably in TableMatrix::Spreadsheet


1.1  2004-02-12

* Updated to be compatible with the new Tk804 series.


1.01  2002-12-06

* Fixed Error where the rowHeight method
  was getting executed like a colWidth. This was introduced in the
  update of TkTable 2.5 to 2.6

1.0  2002-12-02

* Updated core C-code for the changes made from TkTable 2.6 to 2.8.
  (Tk::TableMatrix is derived from the TkTable Tcl/Tk Widget.
    See tktable.sourceforge.net ) 
    
  From the TkTable 2.7 and 2.8 Release Notes:
  
    * Corrected memory leaks in caching.
    * Added the ability to select borders with Button1.
    * Added global -justify option.
  
    * Added -ipadx/-ipady table options and swapped them with
      the old -padx/-pady.  This gives better control over the
      cell padding. **** POTENTIAL INCOMPATABILITY ****
    * -borderwidth now takes up to 4 values to allow you to
      customize edge edge of a cell.
    * Added priorities to tags, so tags can be raised and
      lowered in priority. **** POTENTIAL INCOMPATABILITY ****  
      
* Numerous minor bugs fixed.

0.9  2002-05-22

* Added an experimental widget: SpreadsheetHideRows. This enables
  display of tabular info, with selectable hide/unhide of detail
  data. See demos/SpreadsheetHideRows
  
* Numerous minor bugs fixed.
  
0.8  2001-10-05

* Removed un-needed dependencies on Data::Parse and Date::Format
  for TableMatrix::Spreadsheet
  
* Fixed problem with the selection going nuts when dragging the 
  selection out of the window.

0.71  2001-6-15

* Fixed to compile with the new Tk800.023 release.

0.7  2001-06-07

* Added TableMatrix::Spreadsheet widget. This is a TableMatrix Derived
        widget with Excel-like bindings.

* Reverted back to the cell sorting method implemented in tktable 2.5 (and
	TableMatrix 0.3).  The new cell sorting method didn't sort negative
	row/column indexes correctly, which caused the data from a
	copy/paste operation to be out-of-order, if the selection included
        multiple negative row/col indexes.
	
* Fixed control +/- key bindings for modifying the column with. 
        (Patch from Slaven)
	
0.5  2000-12-20

* Updated to be consistent with tkTable 2.6


0.3  2000-09-16

* Initial Release (based on tkTable 2.5)
